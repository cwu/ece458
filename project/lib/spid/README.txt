The SPID algorithm would probably never have seen the light of the
Internet if it wouldn't have been for .SE (The Internet Infrastructure
Foundation). .SE have provided funding for the research performed by
Erik Hjelmvik and kindly helped finding good ways to communicate the
idea and results from the project to the world.
